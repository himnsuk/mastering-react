            <p><strong>Section Overview | AgeTeller</strong></p>

<p>Congratulations on completing your first application in React! By finishing this project, you saw many fundamental React concepts in action.</p>



<p>Also, at this time, feel free to take a coding break. Remember, the pace of this course lies entirely in your hands. If you’d like to grab something to drink to keep your mind energized, by all means, go ahead! Or if you want to soldier on to the code, then please do so!</p>



<p>Alright, here are the important concepts we covered by building AgeTeller:</p>



<ul><li><p>The <strong>ReactDOM </strong>handles the rendering of our application’s components onto specific pieces of the application’s html.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>react-bootstrap</strong> package provides plenty of useful tools that allow us to create nicely styled forms and other custom components.</p></li><li><p>With the <strong>constructor()</strong> and <strong>super()</strong> combination, we allow components to have dynamic state.</p></li><li><p>By passing data through <strong>props</strong>, components receive data from their parents.</p></li><li><p>Keyframe animations handle dynamic styling in an application.</p></li></ul>



<p>Once again, congratulations on building AgeTeller. Let’s now continue and start exploring Redux - a very popular alternative to managing state within React applications!</p>

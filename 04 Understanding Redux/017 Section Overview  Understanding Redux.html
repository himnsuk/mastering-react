            <p><strong>Section Overview | Understanding Redux</strong></p>

<p>Let’s review the motivation behind redux.</p>







<p>Highly complex applications will often develop equally complicated ways of managing state between components. This can quickly become tangled, messy, and difficult to work with. Redux provides a solution.</p>







<p>With the three step recipe, Redux allows us to easily manage advanced React applications:</p>



<ol><li>The Store represents the state of our Redux application as one giant object.</li><li>Reducers describe ways in which we can update the store.</li><li>Actions activate reducers to eventually update the store</li></ol><p>Altogether, Redux boils down to these three simple items: the store, reducers, and actions. As a team, they provide a simple yet highly powerful method to handle data in our apps.<br></p>







<p>With that, we can now move on coding our first Redux application! Let’s move on!</p>

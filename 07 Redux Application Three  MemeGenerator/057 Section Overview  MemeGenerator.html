            <p><strong>Section Overview | MemeGenerator</strong></p>

<p> Congratulations on completing the final application in this course! With MemeGenerator completed, you will always have a nice reference for how to use middleware and handle asynchronous actions with redux.</p>



<p> Now, you can celebrate! You’ve made it, and can create complex web applications using redux.</p>



<p> ***</p>



<p> Here’s a brief overview of the main concepts that appeared in this section</p>



<ul><li><p>Asynchronous actions complete at an unforeseeable amount of time. But redux allows us to have action creators that return functions to handle asynchronous actions through middleware.</p></li><li><p>Middleware lies between the request and response layer of redux and runs some code, i.e. debugging and logging.</p></li><li><p>The x-www-form-encoded represents a type of application content that certain apis allow their POST endpoints to accept data from.</p></li></ul>



<p> If you’d like to continue coding MemeGenerator, here’s some ideas for challenges you may consider:</p>



<ul><li><p>Add a search field to find specific memes by name.</p></li><li><p>Change the UI to have a confirm button rather than creating on a meme click.</p></li><li><p>Update the reducers to change a notion of a “selected meme” that updates every time the top text, bottom text, and meme image also changes.</p></li><li><p>Add a download button, that downloads the selected created meme using the link as a file source.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>Once again, congratulations!</strong> <strong><em>This isn’t the end</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>though</em></strong><strong>. Be sure to make it to the conclusion section for some last words and following steps!</strong></p>

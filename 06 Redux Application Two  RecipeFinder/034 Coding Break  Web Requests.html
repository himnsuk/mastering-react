            <p><strong>Coding Break | Web Requests</strong></p>

<p>Just so you know, these coding breaks are options. Skip ahead if you want to get right back to building RecipeFinder!</p>

<p>Let’s take some time to go over <strong>web requests.</strong> On the web, companies and organizations store large databases of information. They have lists of users, collections of folders, and massive troves of files. Some companies allow developers to interact with that information with web requests and APIs.</p>

<p>These APIs allow for all different types of web requests, including <em>GET, POST, HEAD, DELETE, </em>and more. Most often, you’ll use the <strong>GET </strong>and <strong>POST </strong>web requests.</p>

<p><strong>GET</strong> allows you to receive information from the API based on specific parameters.</p>

<p><strong>POST</strong> sends data to the API for the company to work with.</p>

<p>And that covers a quick intro to Web Requests!</p>
